This is a private project for my own edification, and a learning experience. I hope to do an in-depth analysis of the texts of Vatican II, to better understand the Council, its goals, and how the modern Church can better interact with the world around her.

So far, I have generated datasets (in .csv format) and graphs tracking parenthetical citations of Scripture for each document of Vatican II like the following:
![Dei Verbum Full Text Bar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda9a0f9-b316-4b5a-9102-1d4cc03bec35)
![Presbyterorum_Ordinis_Pie](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58ce2a7-94b4-4703-8c0b-19b223ebc2d4)

**Major findings:**

The documents of Vatican II cite Scripture a total of 410 times. Of these, an overwhelming 96% (395 citations) come from the New Testament. Below is the breakdown of references between the Old and New Testaments:

New Testament References:


The Gospel of John is cited the most, accounting for 14% of all New Testament citations (55 times).

The Gospel of Matthew and the Epistle to the Romans are tied for second, each cited 44 times (11%).

Acts of the Apostles is cited 37 times (9%).

These 4 books are the most cited throughout the entire council, making up **45%** of the New Testament citations.


Old Testament References:


The Book of Genesis is the most cited, making up 53% of all Old Testament references (8 times).

The Psalms are cited 4 times (26%).

The disparity in citation distribution is understandable; as the Church operates under the New Covenant, it is natural that the New Testament would be referenced more frequently, without disregarding the importance of the Old Testament.

**Major Insights:**

The Church’s frequent use of the New Testament (96% of all citations) suggests there’s no issue with prioritizing the New Testament in personal reading. This reassures me that focusing on the New Testament more heavily is both appropriate and reflective of the Church’s own practice.

For those exploring Christianity, it’s wise to start with the Gospels, particularly John, followed by Acts of the Apostles, and then delve into theological writings like Romans.

When studying the Old Testament, Genesis appears to be a foundational book. Any deep study should likely begin here. The Psalms, accounting for 26% of the Old Testament references, are also important, particularly as a source of prayer.


**Next steps:**

scan the appendices of each document for quotes by saints (especially St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Anselm, and other Doctors). Curate the documents such that allusions to the Scriptures are accounted for (such as references to Abraham, Moses, and David). Finally, deploy the findings to a website for others to reference and learn from.
